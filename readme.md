## Folder Structure Explained

The project directory contains five different folders, but only the “basic” folder is relevant for our current project purposes. This folder includes the training and evaluation pipelines for the NER system, as well as visualization scripts.

### Relevant Folder

	basic: This folder contains the essential scripts for training and evaluating the NER model. It includes:
    
        •	train_ner.py: Script for training the NER model.
        •	evaluate_ner.py: Script for evaluating the NER model.
        •	visualize_performance.py: Script for generating visualizations of the evaluation results.
        •	Supporting files and directories for training and test data.

### Other Folders

The other folders are included in the project directory but are not necessary for the current implementation. They contain initial attempts to create Python packages and other exploratory work, which are not used in this project.

Please focus on the “basic” folder for the training, evaluation, and visualization of the NER system.You can also find 'report.md' inside.

Thank you.
